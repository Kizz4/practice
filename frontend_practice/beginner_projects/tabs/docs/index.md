# Simple Tabs UI

This project is part of the [Frontend Projects Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/frontend/projects) for beginners.  
You can find the specific project details [here](https://roadmap.sh/projects/simple-tabs).

The goal of this project is to teach you how to build a **basic tabbed interface** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
Only one tab’s content should be visible at a time, and the first tab should be active by default.

---

## 📚 Key Requirements

- **JavaScript Logic**: Use event listeners to update the active tab and show the corresponding content.
- **Default Active Tab**: The first tab should be displayed on page load.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Users should be able to switch tabs using the keyboard (focus).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
