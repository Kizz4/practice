# Datepicker UI

This project is part of the [Frontend Projects Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/frontend/projects) for beginners. 
Here is the [link to the project](https://roadmap.sh/projects/datepicker-ui).

The goal of this project is to create a simple date picker UI using only HTML and CSS. 
It is a static component that can later be enhanced with JavaScript for interactivity.
