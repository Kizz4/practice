        <h2>Front-End Developer — Turning Ideas into Real Interfaces</h2>
        <p>
          As a passionate front-end developer with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
          I craft clean, accessible, and responsive web interfaces.
          My background in full stack development allows me to collaborate effectively across teams,
          but my true focus lies in creating intuitive user experiences and visually polished front-ends.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through academic and personal projects, I've built everything from single-page applications
          with React and GraphQL to MVC-style websites with secure image uploads and REST APIs.
          Whether it's implementing XSS protection, structuring semantic HTML for SEO,
          or connecting to a real GraphQL backend, I strive to write maintainable code with users in mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Curious by nature and self-driven, I thrive in collaborative environments where quality,
          autonomy, and creativity matter. For me, being a developer means more than writing code
          — it's about building tools that solve real problems and delight real people.
        </p>
        <h3>Technologies I love working with</h3>
        <p>HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React, GraphQL, Git, and a growing appreciation for UI/UX design.</p>

          <h3 class="visually-hidden">Testimonial from Laurent Delorme</h3>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Gabriel quickly stood out in my web development class thanks
              to his structured thinking and clean code. He tends to take his time to ensure
              things are done right — which can slow him down slightly under pressure —
              but the results are consistently solid and thoughtfully designed.
              He shows a strong awareness of user experience,
              which is rare for someone still in training.
            </p>

          <h3 class="visually-hidden">Testimonial from Cécile Martin</h3>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Gabriel is an independent and curious learner who doesn't hesitate to dive
              deep into complex topics. He sometimes focuses too much on understanding every
              detail before moving forward, but this leads to very reliable and well-grounded work.
              His Python project on trajectory analysis using clustering and pattern extraction
              was a perfect blend of theory and real-world application.
            </p>

          <h3 class="visually-hidden">Testimonial from Jean-Baptiste Leroy</h3>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Gabriel went ahead of the class and built a complete mobile task manager app
              using Flutter and a Laravel-based REST API. The project was ambitious and functional,
              though the UI could have benefited from a bit more visual polish.
              He's very self-driven — sometimes a bit quiet in team discussions —
              but always engaged and open to feedback.
            </p>
