# Accessible Form UI

This project is part of the [Frontend Projects Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/frontend/projects) for beginners.  
You can find the specific project details [here](https://roadmap.sh/projects/accessible-form-ui).

The goal of this project is to design and build an **accessible and responsive user profile form** using semantic HTML and CSS.  
The form includes fields for full name, email, password, and confirm password, along with a button to toggle the visibility of the password text.  
Additionally, the form features a completeness progress bar and a checklist of requirements that must be met for the form to reach 100% completeness.  
While this version of the form won’t be functional, it will be a static UI component that can be enhanced with JavaScript in the future.
