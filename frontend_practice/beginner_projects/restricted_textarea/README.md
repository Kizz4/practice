# Restricted Textarea

This project is part of the [Frontend Projects Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/frontend/projects) for beginners.  
You can find the specific project details [here](https://roadmap.sh/projects/restricted-textarea).

The purpose of this project is to build a restricted textarea component that limits the number of characters a user can enter. This is useful for forms where users must keep their input concise, such as feedback forms, social media posts, or short descriptions.

## 📚 Key Requirements

- **Textarea with Character Limit**: Implement a `<textarea>` field that restricts input to a specific number of characters (e.g., 250).
- **Live Character Counter**: Display a real-time counter showing how many characters have been entered.
- **Styling When Over Limit**: Visually indicate (e.g., with red color or border) when the user exceeds the limit.
