# Restricted Textarea

This project is part of the [Frontend Projects Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/frontend/projects) for beginners.  
You can find the specific project details [here](https://roadmap.sh/projects/restricted-textarea).

The purpose of this project is to build a restricted textarea component that limits the number of characters a user can enter. This is useful for forms where users must keep their input concise, such as feedback forms, social media posts, or short descriptions.
