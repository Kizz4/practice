# Single-Page CV 
This project is part of the [Frontend Projects Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/frontend/projects) for beginners. And the [link](https://roadmap.sh/projects/single-page-cv) of the project himself 

The goal of this project is to teach you how to create a structured, single-page CV using only HTML. You will focus on laying out your education, skills, and career history in a clean, semantic manner. Styling will be addressed in a later project.

Key requirements for this project:

    Semantic HTML: Use appropriate HTML tags to structure your CV.
    SEO Meta Tags: Include essential meta tags for SEO.
    Open Graph (OG) Tags: Add OG tags for better social media sharing.
    Favicon: Add a favicon for your CV page.

The structure of your CV is easily understandable and ready for styling in a future project.
