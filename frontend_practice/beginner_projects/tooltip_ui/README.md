# Tooltip UI

This project is part of the [Frontend Projects Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/frontend/projects) for beginners.  
You can find the specific project details [here](https://roadmap.sh/projects/tooltip-ui).

The goal of this project is to teach you how to create a **tooltip for navigation items** using **only HTML and CSS**.  
Tooltips are small pop-up boxes that provide additional information about an element when a user hovers over it.
