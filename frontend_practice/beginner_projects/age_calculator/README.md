# Age Calculator

This project is part of the [Frontend Projects Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/frontend/projects) for beginners.  
You can find the specific project details [here](https://roadmap.sh/projects/age-calculator).

The goal of this project is to create an accessible and responsive application that calculates a user's exact age in years and months based on their date of birth. The calculator should use a datepicker and a date library to handle the logic.
