# Changelog component

This project is part of the [Frontend Projects Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/frontend/projects) for beginners.  
And the [link](https://roadmap.sh/projects/changelog-component) of the project himself.

The goal of this project is to create a responsive and accessible changelog component using HTML and CSS.  
It showcases a timeline-style table of project updates, with date and description aligned and enhanced by subtle styling like vertical lines, dots, and smooth transitions on interaction.
